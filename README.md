# <img src='https://www.codebypete.com/pics/about/mitxPro_logoStacked.jpg' alt='MIT xPro logo' width='30'> Full Stack Bootcamp: Pac-Men Factory Project

## About
This was developed during Bootcamp Week 5. We were supplied with starter code and PacMan images. 
>**Assignment objectives**:
<ol>
    <li>Make a PacMan at a random position on the screen</li>
    <li>Move PacMan along the x and y-axis at random velocities and trajectories</li>
    <li>PacMan should use alternating images to simulate 'chomping' movement</li>
    <li>PacMan should change direction of movement upon hitting a screen edge</li>
    <li>PacMan image set should change based on direction of horizontal movement</li>
    <li>Project should operate with buttons</li>
</ol>

>**Custom Features**:
<ol>
    <li>Project and buttons are fully responsive using custom CSS and JavaScript</li>
    <li>'Aquarium Theme' with animated background</li>
    <li>PacMan spawns within 'Aquarium' boundaries</li>
    <li>Matching PacMan 'Aqua-Suit' with random colors</li>
    <li>Random spawn sizes</li>
    <li>'Move' button upgraded to 'Start/Stop' toggle button with color feedback</li>
    <li>Button to ZAP! PacMan, which removes the first PacMan element from the array and DOM</li>
    <li>Custom ZAP! animation</li>
</ol>

## How to Run
This project has three buttons, and they operate as follows: 

>***Add PacMan Button***

- Creates a PacMan within aquarium boundaries with random: position, velocity, size, and 'Aqua-Suit' color.

>***Start/Stop Button***

- Starts PacMen moving on their designated trajectory; or Stops them in place.

>***ZAP! PacMan Button***

- Gives the first PacMan in the array a quick, but fatal *ZAP!* They are removed from the array, as well as the DOM.

NOTE: If any PacMen happen become trapped 'out of bounds,' or otherwise behave strangely, a reload should resolve the issue.  This could occur during re-sizing of the 'Aquarium' while the PacMen are moving.


## Future Roadmap
I may incorporate what I learned about handling an array of DOM elements into my [Pac-Man Mini-Game](https://codetracklift.github.io/pacman/) Project.
