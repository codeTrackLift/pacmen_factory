<img src='./images/aquaPacMan.ico' alt='Aqua-PacMan image' width='30'> ***Try Demo:*** [https://codetracklift.github.io/pacmen_factory](https://codetracklift.github.io/pacmen_factory/)

>**Skills Utilized**:
<ol>
    <li>Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
    <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
    <li>JavaScript Objects and Arrays</li>
    <li>Custom CSS Effects</li>
</ol>

## About
This was developed during Bootcamp Week 5. Starter code and PacMan images were supplied. 

>**Assignment Objectives**:
<ol>
    <li>Make a PacMan at a random position on the screen</li>
    <li>Ability to handle an Array of PacMen</li>
    <li>Move PacMen along the x and y-axis at random velocities and trajectories</li>
    <li>PacMen should use alternating images to simulate 'chomping' movement</li>
    <li>PacMen should change direction of movement upon hitting a screen edge</li>
    <li>PacMan image set should change based on direction of horizontal movement</li>
    <li>Project should operate with buttons</li>
</ol>

>**Custom Features**:
<ol>
    <li>Project and buttons are fully responsive using custom CSS and JavaScript</li>
    <li>'Aquarium Theme' with animated background</li>
    <li>PacMan spawns within 'Aquarium' boundaries</li>
    <li>Matching PacMan 'Aqua-Suit' with random colors</li>
    <li>Random spawn sizes</li>
    <li>'Move' button upgraded to 'Start/Stop' toggle button with color feedback</li>
    <li>Button to ZAP! PacMan, which removes the first PacMan element from the array and DOM</li>
    <li>Custom ZAP! animation</li>
</ol>

## How to Run
This project has three buttons, and they operate as follows: 

>***Add PacMan Button***

- Creates a PacMan within aquarium boundaries with random: position, velocity, size, and 'Aqua-Suit' color.

>***Start/Stop Button***

- Starts PacMen moving on their designated trajectory; or Stops them in place.

>***ZAP! PacMan Button***

- Gives the first PacMan in the array a quick, but fatal *ZAP!* They are removed from the array, as well as the DOM.

NOTE: If any PacMen happen become trapped 'out of bounds,' or otherwise behave strangely, a reload should resolve the issue.  This could occur during re-sizing of the 'Aquarium' while the PacMen are moving.

## Future Roadmap
- [x] Create function to remove one PacMan
- [x] Create container for custom PacMan boundaries
- [x] Upgrade 'move' button to toggle 'start/stop'
- [x] Customize and make it fun!
- [x] Make fully responsive
- [x] Make mobile compatible

This is a progression project, no further development is anticipated.
